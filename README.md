<h3> About Project </h3>
This Project was made for household gardening enthusiasts. Project Garden Gnome is a web application that informs the user regarding the feasibility of the current weather conditions of the user's location with respect to any plant of the user's choice.
This will help the user make certain important decisions such as whether to move the plant they are nurturing away from sunlight or into sunlight, to shelter it from rain and wind or provide it more water, and so on, based on the current weather.

<h3> Working or Functioning of the Project </h3>
For those savvy enough; using Python, Django, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, we have created a website that lets the user choose a plant from a dummy database, type their city location and let the site do the rest. The site displays the current humidity, sunlight and temperature levels and compares them to the ideal conditions required by the plant the user chose to grow healthily. On a larger scale, the site would use an infinitely larger database of plants, crops, flowers and the likes, and the conditions they require, which at the time of creating this project (given 2 days to finish it) was not realistically possible.
